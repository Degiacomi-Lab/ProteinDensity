A range of random forest regressors trained on different features at both 310.15 K and 300 K are supplied here. When temperature is not noted, the temperature is 310.15 K as standard.

> RF_all is trained on the mean values of the mean values of all features (see figure S21 for a full list of features) for each protein in the 260-protein dataset.
> RF_20 (AKA: struct_RF) is trained on the mean values of the 20 features found to be of the most importance by the ablation study (see figure S19 and S22).
> RF_seq is trained on only the sequence data (the percentage composition of the protein sequence by residue) of each protein.

300K folder contains results obtained from 300 K simulations of proteins from a protein structure dataset derived from the Protein-Protein Docking Benchmark 5 (see: Vreven, Thom, Iain H. Moal, Anna Vangone, Brian G. Pierce, Panagiotis L. Kastritis, Mieczyslaw Torchala, Raphael Chaleil et al. "Updates to the integrated proteinâ€“protein interaction benchmarks: docking benchmark version 5 and affinity benchmark version 2." Journal of molecular biology 427, no. 19 (2015): 3031-3041.).
21 structures captured between 0 and 1 ns inclusive of a production run of an MD simulation for each protein structure are extracted.
The feature values consist of a range of physical characteristic values of a protein, ranging from the Solvent Accessible Surface Area to the percentage of residues in a coil configuration.

> RF_300 is trained on all extracted features for all simulation snapshot structures (21 for each protein).
> RF_300_means is trained on the mean values for each feature for each protein.
> RF_300_seq is trained on only the sequence data (the percentage composition of the protein sequence by residue) of each protein.
